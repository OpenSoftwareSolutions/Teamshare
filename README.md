Teamshare 
=========

Teamshare is a decentralized file-sharing application with emphasis on privacy,
security and portability.
 
With Teamshare you can:
* form groups
* invite friends into your groups
* store files inside your groups
* synchronize your files on all your devices in a secure and faster way

No centralized server stores your data because synchronization is performed by
using peer-to-peer technology for each group. All communication is secured and
data is locally stored in an encrypted format.
